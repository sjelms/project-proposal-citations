  abstract  = {Architects have been intrigued by prefabricated construction
               since the early twentieth century. Recent advances in design,
               engineering and manufacturing processes have led to a significant
               expansion in the use of pre-assembled components, which are
               fitted to finished structures on site. Collectively, such
               processes are becoming known as *offsite construction*. A
               ground-breaking text, Offsite Architecture establishes the
               current – and future – state of thinking in this field. A range
               of the most highly regarded thinkers and practitioners from
               around the globe share their ideas and practical findings on
               offsite prefabrication, examining theory and practice,
               opportunities and challenges, successes and failures. A timely
               response to the growing interest in this method, the book
               provides the fundamental basis for a critical, reflective
               approach to offsite architecture. Contributions from both
               academics and professionals make Offsite Architecture required
               reading for practitioners as well as students taking courses in
               architecture, prefabrication, construction and engineering.},

  abstract     = {The concept of human capital is very common in present-day
                  construction industry with reference to its philosophy and
                  techniques. Human capital (HC) is widely discussed in
                  different fields; hence, its meanings differ from one field to
                  another. This study provides a detailed discussion on the
                  development of the human capital theory under various themes
                  and sub-themes. The study further seeks to discuss the several
                  effects of human capital development on industry success and
                  competitiveness and how this contributes to economic growth in
                  developing countries. Relevant literatures on HC theory and
                  development were extracted from Scopus. Scopus is widely
                  acknowledged as one of the widest interdisciplinary databases
                  for engineering, technology, science and medicine. The Scopus
                  database features over 20, 000+ peer-reviewed journals from
                  over 5000 publishers. The Scopus database allows its users to
                  perform more detailed searching opportunities compared to
                  other databases such as Academic Search Complete, Art and
                  Architecture Complete, Ebsco Host, SpringerLink and Web of
                  science. The distillation of literature through thematic
                  analysis revealed the various roles of human capital and its
                  correlation with construction industry success and growth.
                  Findings from this study revealed that the success of the
                  construction industry is firmly related to the effectiveness
                  of its human capital. The study revealed that the human
                  capital theory is not without its criticisms and barriers.
                  Practically, this study explores the various benefits of human
                  capital to employers of the construction industry. The study
                  suggests that human capital development plays a key part in
                  retaining quality employees and recruiting prospects.
                  Furthermore, investment in human capital goes a long way in
                  improving employee satisfaction, organisational culture and
                  increased productivity. This study contributes to the human
                  capital discourse, which is the measure of economic value
                  provided by employees with reference to their abilities,
                  skills, values and knowledge.},

                  Computers and Human Behavior, 25(2), 450–457, 2005). Our
                  original work operationalized three instructional roles as
                  simulated through pedagogical agents, and demonstrated the
                  effectiveness of these agent roles on learning and motivation.
                  Since the publication of our work, pedagogical agent research
                  has expanded its scope from the provision of intelligent
                  guidance to a broad interest in agents’ social and affective
                  support for learners. We discuss current progress in
                  pedagogical agent roles and capabilities, and speculate about
                  the future of agent role design. We expect that optimizing the
                  roles of artificial beings including on-screen agents and
                  robots will continue to interest the educational technology
                  community as these technologies continue to evolve.},

                  benefits in terms of improvements in productivity and quality,
                  this concept has not gained much attention in the construction

                  far-reaching implications of the increasingly digitised and

                  Interactive media now enable various degrees of digital
                  immersion. The more a virtual immersive experience is based on

                  perspectives, situated learning, and transfer. Further studies

                  needed to enhance the construction management educational
                  experience. One of these new methods is showing real time
                  videos that highlight the various elements of concern in the
                  classroom lecture. The purpose of this paper is to use
                  augmented reality technology (ART) and a layer of artificial
                  visualizations to simulate the environmental context and
                  spatio-temporal constraints of various construction processes.
                  The superimposition of images serves as an instructional
                  mechanism to virtually incorporate jobsite experiences into
                  classrooms. This enhancement of spatio-temporal constraints
                  enables learners to visualize context and hidden processes
                  otherwise unattainable through traditional classroom lectures.
                  Design/methodology/approach A significantly improved
                  perception of reality is created through the combination of
                  the learners’ ability to understand the complexity of
                  construction products (e.g. assemblies) and associated jobsite
                  processes by viewing the real environment augmented with
                  computer-generated information layers. Findings Testing the
                  ART video in a classroom with undergraduate construction
                  management students showed that students who were exposed to
                  the ART video were able to remember and identify the
                  highlighted elements in the corresponding assembly more
                  effectively than those who were not. Originality/value ART is
                  a valuable tool in enhancing classroom learning and gives
                  educators a teaching advantage when they combine traditional
                  classroom lectures with ART enabled media.},

                  ITSs are computer-based learning systems which attempt to
                  adapt to the needs of learners and are therefore the only such
                  systems which attempt to 'care' about learners in that sense.
                  Also, ITS research is the only part of the general IT and
                  education field which has as its scientific goal to make
                  computationally precise and explicit forms of educational,
                  psychological and social knowledge which are often left
                  implicit.

  abstract     = {With the rapid growth of technology, computer learning has
                  become increasingly integrated with artificial intelligence
                  techniques in order to develop more personalized educational
                  systems. These systems are known as Intelligent Tutoring
                  systems (ITSs). This paper focused on the variant
                  characteristics of ITSs developed across different educational
                  fields. The original studies from 2007 to 2017 were extracted
                  from the PubMed, ProQuest, Scopus, Google scholar, Embase,
                  Cochrane, and Web of Science databases. Finally, 53 papers
                  were included in the study based on inclusion criteria. The
                  educational fields in the ITSs were mainly computer sciences
                  (37.73\%). Action-condition rule-based reasoning, data mining,
                  and Bayesian network with 33.96\%, 22.64\%, and 20.75\%
                  frequency respectively, were the most frequent artificial
                  intelligent techniques applied in the ITSs. These techniques
                  enable ITSs to deliver adaptive guidance and instruction,
                  evaluate learners, define and update the learner’s model, and
                  classify or cluster learners. Specifically, the performance of
                  the system, learner’s performance, and experiences were used
                  for evaluation of ITSs. Most ITSs were designed for web user
                  interfaces. Although these systems could facilitate reasoning
                  in the learning process, these systems have rarely been
                  applied in experimental courses including problem-solving,
                  decision-making in physics, chemistry, and clinical fields.
                  Due to the important role of a cell phone in facilitating
                  personalized learning and given the low rate of using
                  mobile-based ITSs, this study has recommended the development
                  and evaluation of mobile-based ITSs.},

  abstract    = {Skilled labor is vital to the success of any construction
                 project, and no contractor would be able to operate without the
                 skilled laborers that they employ. The construction industry
                 has been subject to a shortage of skilled labor for the last
                 two decades for many reasons, including the poor image of
                 construction workers among the public, inadequate training
                 measures, and an aging workforce. Reviewing the literature on
                 the matter shows that the leading cause of shortage is low pay
                 and increasing age of the workforce overall, while the demand
                 for labor grows at a faster rate than the supply of labor
                 grows. Poor worker retention practices were also identified as
                 a cause for shortage and a reason for workers leaving the
                 industry, and proper retention tactics are assessed, including
                 monetary and non-monetary considerations for workers in order
                 to foster a better employer-employee relationship. Recruiting
                 practices among labor unions and contractors are also assessed
                 through interviews and research, with the results suggesting
                 that a greater emphasis should be put on improving the image of
                 construction workers in the public eye, increasing the prestige
                 of a job in construction and leading to increased participation
                 in the construction industry among young people.},

  abstract     = {Construction is a trade where the dominating production
                  strategy is engineer-to-order. House-builders can pre-engineer
                  their design to different degrees, resulting in variations of
                  the engineer-to-order strategy: design-to-order,
                  adapt-to-order, and engineer-to-stock. This variation causes
                  different settings for the use of platforms in house-building.
                  The aim of this research is to diversify the engineer-to-order
                  production strategy and its consequences for platform
                  organization by studying its use in house-building. The
                  multiple case study on four engineering/contractor firms
                  reports the core capabilities for engineer-to-order firms:
                  procurement and tendering, market knowledge, engineering,
                  multi-skilled manufacturing, and coordination of sales and
                  manufacturing. Design-to-order, adapt-to-order and engineer-to
                  stock were shown to be production strategies in use in
                  house-building. In design-to-order platforms parts of the
                  platform are undefined while engineer-to-stock platforms are
                  fully predefined. Coordination between market and
                  manufacturing is a crucial capability when engaging in
                  platform organization. When an engineering firm and a
                  contractor collaborate to fulfil client needs, the
                  coordination capability between market and manufacturing was
                  shown to be low. The case study shows that specialized
                  contractors who integrate the supply chain towards a specific
                  market segment benefit fully from the platform concept, while
                  contractors with a wider scope could focus on standardization
                  of processes rather than products.},

                 industry to create and maintain competent workers;
                 unfortunately, most construction training and education
                 research focuses on university student education. The focus of
                 this dissertation research is the current state of
                 educational-theory embedded construction workforce training,
                 how such trainings are effective, and how they may be further
                 optimized based on established educational theory. This is
                 accomplished through a review of construction training for
                 current industry professionals, an evaluation of the assessment
                 criteria used to measure effectiveness, followed by the
                 creation of a framework for construction training. There is a
                 lack of recommendations for improvement of construction
                 training across the industry. To establish the current state of
                 construction industry training, a review of education
                 theory-integrated training for construction professionals is
                 undertaken. To measure the extent of educational theory
                 integration, this dissertation summarizes studies that meet
                 inclusion criteria, identifies the frequency of occurrence of
                 Bloom’s Taxonomy verbs as a measure of student learning
                 outcomes, and identifies and compares commonly used words
                 within the identified construction training literature and
                 foundational educational theory literature. The results provide
                 a baseline of education theory-integrated construction training
                 research, from which gaps and best practices can be identified.
                 Existing construction training programs are not properly
                 measured for effectiveness. A review of the current
                 methodologies used in construction trainings published in
                 archival literature is conducted to evaluate the effectiveness
                 of training programs. These practices are compared against the
                 Kirkpatrick Model, an evaluation framework. The assessment
                 methodologies in the literature are synthesized with
                 corresponding levels found in the Kirkpatrick Model. Properly
                 integrating educational theory into construction workforce
                 training has the potential to improve industry training;
                 however, there is a dearth of studies that present details of
                 this integration process. To address this gap, a training
                 framework is created to educate material installers on material

                 based on andragogical and Universal Design for Learning (UDL)
                 principles. An assessment tool provides a method of evaluating
                 similar training agendas to improve instructional design before
                 training implementation. The created framework culminates by
                 establishing linkages from educational theory to proposed
                 training modules.},

  abstract     = {Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to investigate the
                  current skills gap in both generic and skill areas within the
                  construction industry in Queensland, Australia.
                  Design/methodology/approach – An internet-based survey was
                  administered to collect the opinions of construction employees
                  about the workplace-training environment and their perceptions
                  towards training. The survey intended to address the following
                  research questions, specifically in relation to the
                  construction industry. Findings – The survey results reveal
                  that whilst overall participation in workplace training is
                  high, the current workplace training environments do not
                  foster balanced skill development. The study reveals that in
                  the current absence of a formal and well-balanced training
                  mechanism, construction workers generally resort to their own
                  informal self-development initiatives to develop the needed
                  role-specific theoretical knowledge. Research
                  limitations/implications – The findings of the research are
                  based on the data primarily collected in the construction
                  industry in Queensland, Australia. The data are limited to a
                  single Tier 2 construction company. Practical implications –
                  The findings of this study can be utilised to suggest
                  improvements in the current (or develop new) workplace
                  training initiatives. Social implications – The research
                  suggests that workplace training has positive relationship
                  with career growth. The results suggest that in the
                  construction industry, employees are generally well aware of
                  the importance of workplace training in their career
                  development and they largely appreciate training as being a
                  critical factor for developing their capacity to perform their
                  roles successfully, and to maintain their employability.
                  Originality/value – This paper is unique as it investigates
                  the current skills gap in both generic and skill areas within
                  the construction industry in Queensland, Australia. So far no
                  work has been undertaken to identify and discusses the main
                  method of workplace learning within the Tier 2 industry in the
                  context of Queensland Australia.},

                  training's identity has been founded on four types of
                  characteristics: epistemological, teleological, hierarchical
                  and pragmatic. No single characteristic is found to be
                  adequate to identify vocational education and training across
                  jurisdictions, and across historical periods. Both Rushbrook
                  and Stevenson seek for vocational education and training what
                  Rushbrook calls an ?abstracted institutional teleology?. Yet
                  such a quest may degenerate into essentialism, and in any case
                  is vulnerable to being made obsolete by the changes that
                  vocational education and training is meant to be stimulating
                  and to equip us for life. The article concludes by arguing for
                  a definition of vocational education and training which is a
                  compound of the four general characteristics considered.},

  abstract     = {The building and construction sector is a large contributor to
                  anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and consumes the
                  vastest amount of natural resources. Widely considered a
                  hard-to-decarbonise sector, improvements in buildings and
                  construction are of fundamental importance for national and
                  global targets to combat climate change. At material level,
                  mitigation opportunities exist in terms of efficiency (using
                  less of the same material) and substitution (using a different
                  material). This article investigates the latter, with a global
                  focus on the use of cross laminated timber to replace concrete
                  floors in steel structural systems. This approach, whilst
                  innovative, does not require any technological development nor
                  upskilling of current professional practice, thus making it an
                  immediately viable solution to accelerate decarbonisation. We
                  combine Material Flow Analysis with Life Cycle Assessment
                  across both spatial and temporal dimensions, accounting for
                  different levels of uptake of the proposed hybrid construction
                  in the next 30 years. Results show that greenhouse gas
                  emissions saving potentials range between 20 and 80 Mt CO2e
                  (95\% confidence interval) with an average around 50 Mt CO2e
                  in the case of full uptake of the hybrid construction system
                  by 2050. Our analysis does not account for carbon
                  sequestration potential in timber, which would make the
                  savings much greater. Still, the overall savings represent a
                  1.5\% reduction of the annual greenhouse gas emissions
                  generally attributed to construction, thus making it a
                  non-trivial contribution to progress towards global targets of
                  net-zero carbon buildings.},

                  urban population would be housed in newly built urban mid-rise
                  buildings with wooden constructions, 106 Gt of additional CO2
                  could be saved by 2100. Forest plantations would need to
                  expand by up to 149 Mha by 2100 and harvests from unprotected
                  natural forests would increase. Our results indicate that

  abstract  = {Workplace learning often requires workers to learn new perceptual
               and motor skills. The future of work will increasingly feature
               human users who cooperate with machines, both to learn the tasks
               and to perform them. In this paper, we examine workplace learning
               in Materials Recovery Facilities (MRFs), i.e., recycling plants,
               where workers separate waste items on conveyer belts before they
               are formed into bales and reprocessed. Using a simulated MRF, we
               explored the benefit of machine learning assistants (MLAs) that
               help workers, and help train them, to sort objects efficiently by
               providing automated perceptual guidance. In a randomized
               experiment (n = 140), we found: (1) A low-accuracy MLA is worse
               than no MLA at all, both in terms of task performance and
               learning. (2) A perfect MLA led to the best task performance, but
               was no better in helping users to learn than having no MLA at
               all. (3) Users tend to follow the MLA’s judgments too often, even
               when they were incorrect. Finally, (4) we devised a novel
               learning analytics algorithm to assess the worker’s accuracy,
               with the goal of obtaining additional training labels that can be
               used for fine-tuning the machine. A simulation study illustrates
               how even noisy labels can increase the machine’s accuracy.},

  abstract     = {In 2018, during the construction of a motorway in the East
                  Bohemian Region near the town of Ostrov (Czech Republic),
                  archaeologists excavated a structure of a wooden water well
                  lining with a square base area of 80 × 80 cm and 140 cm in
                  height. Due to the excellent conservation of the oak timbers,
                  studies of technological details and precise tree-ring dating
                  were possible. The used trees were felled in the years 5256/55
                  BC, which makes this well the oldest dendrochronologically
                  dated archaeological wooden construction worldwide. It is the
                  third well from the Early Neolithic period that has been
                  discovered in the Czech Republic within the last four years.
                  The design consists of grooved corner posts with inserted
                  planks. This type of construction reveals advanced technical
                  know-how and, till now, is the only known type from this
                  region and time period. Thanks to the combination of annually
                  resolved and absolutely dated tree-ring widths (TRWs), the
                  Czech oak TRW chronology has been significantly extended back
                  to 5481 BC. Wood anatomical identification of fragments from
                  the well filling show mainly oak (Quercus spp.) and hazel
                  (Corylus spp.), indicating a local forest composition
                  dominated by these taxa. The shape of the individual
                  structural elements and tool marks preserved on their surface
                  confirm sophisticated carpentry skills. Based on these
                  observations, we established a model for the “chaîne
                  opératoire” from forest utilization to the final artefact at
                  the beginning of the Early Neolithic period.},

                  unfortunately, most construction training and education
                  research focuses on university student education. Integrating
                  education science theory into construction training has the
                  potential to improve industry training, but the status of this

                  gap, this article undertakes a state-of-the-art review of
                  education theory–integrated construction training for current
                  industry professionals. To measure the extent of educational
                  theory integration, this article identifies and summarizes
                  studies that meet inclusion criteria, identifies the frequency
                  of occurrence of Bloom’s Taxonomy verbs as a measure of
                  student learning outcomes, and identifies and compares
                  commonly used words within the identified construction
                  training literature and foundational educational theory
                  literature. This article presents a systematic review of
                  published construction workforce training studies that have
                  incorporated educational theory in the design and
                  implementation of the training. The results reveal that, of
                  the 15 construction training studies that met the inclusion
                  criteria, two-thirds (2/3) focused on worker safety and only
                  three studies (20\%) targeted managers or designers. Fewer
                  than 35\% of terms that were identified as frequently used
                  terms in the published construction training studies were
                  categorized as educational. The results of this study provide
                  a baseline of education theory–integrated construction
                  training research, from which gaps and best practices can be

               interpretation of American business history during the formative
               years 1870-1920, which mark the dawn of modern big business. It
               focuses on four major revolutions that ushered in this new era:
               those in power, transportation, communication, and organization.
               Using the metaphor of America as an economic hothouse uniquely
               suited to rapid economic growth during these years, it analyzes
               the interplay of key factors such as entrepreneurial talent,
               technology, land, natural resources, law, mass markets, and the
               rise of cities. It also delineates the process that laid the
               foundation for the modern era, in which virtually every human
               activity became a business, and, in most cases, a big business.
               The book also profiles numerous major entrepreneurs whose careers
               and activities illustrate broader trends and themes. It utilizes
               a wide variety of sources, including novels from the period, to

                  industrial revolution and new platforms of information
                  technologies, intelligent systems have received widespread
                  attention in many industries and have brought the potential to
                  improve the efficiency of the construction industry. These
                  facts led to the appearance of a new concept in construction
                  industry called Construction 4.0. Therefore, this article
                  seeks to explore the state of implementation of Industry 4.0
                  technologies in the construction industry and analyze their
                  impact on the formation of the Construction 4.0 concept. In
                  order to achieve the aim of this article, a literature review
                  was conducted using the most relevant publication in this
                  field. Moreover, authors carried out a bibliometric analysis
                  among 195 selected research articles related to the Industry
                  4.0 and Construction 4.0 to identify interconnections between
                  these concepts. The results show that Industry 4.0 has the
                  greatest impact on productivity growth in construction and
                  that interest in digital technologies is growing every year,
                  but their penetration into the construction industry is
                  currently slow and limited. The authors suggest that further
                  research needs to be focused on future ethical issues that may

                  lack of accommodation in Sweden, and during a ten- year period
                  about one million new homes were built- the Million Homes
                  programme. These buildings constitute about one fourth of the
                  entire Swedish building stock and thus have a high societal
                  value. Today they do not always meet current building
                  standards and many are in need of refurbishment. The Million
                  Homes programme incorporated a large variety of technical
                  building solutions, andknowledge about former building
                  practices is needed if refurbishment is to be successful.
                  Industrialised builders in Sweden have recognized the use of a
                  platform as one means of sharing knowledge. A platform is
                  essentially the collection of assets that are shared by a set
                  of products. In a platform for housing refurbishment the
                  assets have knowledge and process content (as opposed to
                  product content) and will probably also contain many
                  relationships. The interview study carried out as part of the
                  research shows that the main purpose of a platform concept is
                  to standardize components and processes. To increase the
                  possibility that a platform concept for refurbishment of
                  buildings will beused for knowledge sharing the focus should
                  be on the individuals who will actually be sharing their
                  knowledge and especially on social motivations. It is
                  important that managers and leaders demonstrate knowledge
                  sharing behaviors as this will lead to the establishment of a
                  culture where knowledge sharing is the norm; in the context of
                  this study this is especially important for the creation of an
                  efficient platform concept for refurbishment.},

               Essentially, grounded theory methods consist of flexible
               strategies for focusing and expediting qualitative data
               collection and analysis. These methods provide a set of inductive
               steps that successively lead the researcher from studying
               concrete realities to rendering a conceptual understanding of
               them. The founders of grounded theory, Barney G. Glaser and
               Anselm L. Strauss (1967), aimed to develop middle-range theories
               from qualitative data. Hence they not only intended to
               conceptualize qualitative data, but planned to demonstrate
               relations between conceptual categories and to specify the
               conditions under which theoretical relationships emerge, change,
               or are maintained.},

  abstract  = {It is only in the last century, and only in industrialized
               nations, that formal schooling has emerged as a widespread method
               of educating the young. Before schools, apprenticeship was the
               most common means of learning, used to transmit the knowledge
               required for expert practice in fields from painting and
               sculpting to medicine and law. Even today, many complex and
               important skills, such as those required for language use and
               social interaction, are learned informally through
               apprenticeshiplike methods--i.e., methods involving not didactic
               teaching, but observation, coaching, and successive approximation
               while carrying out a variety of tasks and activities. The
               differences between formal schooling and apprenticeship methods
               are many, but for our purposes, one is most important. Perhaps as
               a by-product of the specialization of learning in schools, skills
               and knowledge taught in schools have become abstracted from their
               uses in the world. In apprenticeship learning, on the other hand,
               target skills are not only continually in use by skilled
               practitioners, but are instrumental to the accomplishment of
               meaningful tasks. Said differently, apprenticeship embeds the
               learning of skills and knowledge in the social and functional
               context of their use. This difference is not academic, but has
               serious implications for the nature of the knowledge that
               students acquire. This paper attempts to elucidate some of those
               implications through a proposal for the retooling of
               apprenticeship methods for the teaching and learning of cognitive
               skills. Specifically, we propose the development of a new
               cognitive apprenticeship to teach students the thinking and
               problem-solving skills involved in school subjects such as
               reading, writing, and mathematics. The organization of the paper
               is as follows: In the first section, we discuss briefly what we
               believe to be key shortcomings in current curricular and
               pedagogical practices. We then present some of the structural
               features of traditional apprenticeship and discuss, in general,
               what would be required to adapt these characteristics to the
               teaching and learning of cognitive skills. In the second section
               we consider in detail three recently developed pedagogical
               "success models," which we believe exemplify aspects of
               apprenticeship methods in teaching the thinking and reasoning
               skills involved in reading, writing and mathematics. We attempt
               to show how and why these methods are successful with regard to
               the development of not only the cognitive, but also the
               metacognitive, skills requited for true expertise. In the final
               section, we organize our ideas on the purposes and
               characteristics of successful teaching into a general framework
               for the design of learning environments, where "environment"
               includes the content being taught, the pedagogical methods
               employed, the sequencing of learning activities, and the
               sociology of learning. This framework emphasizes how cognitive
               apprenticeship goes beyond the techniques of traditional
               apprenticeship. We hope it will be useful to the field in
               designing, evaluating, and doing research on pedagogical methods,
               materials, and technologies.},

                  Programming Tutor (APT). APT is constructed around a
                  production rule cognitive model of programming knowledge,

                  solve exercises along with the student and provide assistance
                  as necessary. As the student works, the tutor also maintains
                  an estimate of the probability that the student has learned
                  each of the rules in the ideal model, in a process
                  calledknowledge tracing. The tutor presents an individualized

                  probability estimates until the student has ‘mastered’ each

               and to interact with the student based on a deep understanding of
               the students' behavior. This chapter begins by providing an
               overview of intelligent tutoring systems. The chapter comments on
               competing research goals in the field, followed by descriptions
               of two successful systems: (1) the Pittsburgh urban math project
               algebra tutor project and (2) the SHERLOCK project. These two
               systems are being deployed in real-world educational environments
               with substantial success. This chapter briefly describes the
               underlying theory and implementation of each system, to motivate
               later discussions. A description of the standard components in an
               intelligent tutoring system is also presented along with a
               discussion of human-computer interaction assessment issues unique

  abstract     = {This article describes a qualitative study that documented the
                  use of reflection-in-action by adult educators in problematic
                  situations. The focus of the study was to explore aspects of
                  Schön's theory. The results supported the basic assumption of
                  Schön's theory that reflecting practitioners use a
                  constructivist decision-making perspective while
                  non-reflecting educators use an instrumental problem-solving
                  approach. The findings demonstrated that reflecting educators,
                  whether novice or experienced, use reflecting-in-action and
                  reflecting-on-action as a means to develop expertise. The
                  presence of experienced educators exhibiting minimal
                  reflection and presence of one highly reflective novice
                  indicates that experience alone is not the "master teacher" of
                  the reflective process.},

                  state where contemplated questions are of more value than
                  hasty answers. For this reason, this paper is more concerned
                  with theory formulation than theory testing. More
                  specifically, it derives a grounded theory of construction
                  crisis management which forms a useful basis for future
                  research. It does so from an investigation of the complex
                  patterns of communication and behaviour which emerge in
                  response to construction crises. The conclusion is that
                  construction crisis management is about the effective control
                  of social and behavioural instability and the conflict which
                  arises out of it. However, effective crisis management is made
                  difficult by the in-built defence mechanisms which
                  construction crises appear to have. The grounded theory also
                  is contrasted with current crisis management theory and
                  thereby, the uniqueness of crisis management in a construction
                  context is identified.},

               education. But new technologies risk making schools obsolete and
               this book explains why and how today’s educators, policymakers,
               and communities must adapt to provide all learners with access to

  abstract     = {The ‘traditional’ construction industry has constantly been
                  challenged to improve its inherent problematic practices.
                  Offsite production (OSP), under the umbrella of modern methods
                  of construction (MMC), has been acknowledged as a means to
                  help improve construction industry performance as well as meet
                  new market demands through the provision of improved,
                  adaptable, and sustainable buildings. However, the deployment
                  of OSP systems, if not managed properly, may adversely affect
                  the end result and be counterproductive. It is therefore
                  imperative that the construction industry stakeholders learn
                  and appreciate the specifics, merits, as well as the risks
                  associated with OSP systems in order to achieve the desired
                  outcomes and consequently improve industry
                  performance.On-the-job-training (OJT) is usually sought to
                  facilitate ‘experiential’ learning, which is argued to be
                  particularly effective where a great deal of independence is
                  granted to the task performer. However, OJT has been
                  criticised for being expensive, limited, and sometimes devoid
                  of the actual training context. In order to address the
                  problems encountered with OJT, several virtual reality (VR)
                  solutions have been proposed. This paper introduces one such
                  VR solution prototype, in order to provide a risk-free
                  environment for learning without the ‘do-or-die’ consequences
                  often faced on real construction projects. The proffered
                  solution provides a unique VR environment for practicing new
                  working conditions associated with OSP practices. While the
                  ‘scenes’ of the VR environment take place on a construction
                  site, the environment predominantly targets professionals,
                  such as project managers, construction managers, architects,
                  designers, suppliers and manufacturers, to allow
                  multidisciplinary learning to occur, and hence overcome
                  ‘knowledge silos’ or ‘knowledge compartmentation’. The VR
                  environment enables unforeseen problems often caused by
                  professionals’ decisions, faulty work, and health and safety
                  issues to occur; where the implications of which can be
                  evaluated in respect of time, cost and resources. The VR
                  environment proposed does not aim to resolve problems
                  associated with OSP per se, rather aims to allow ‘things to go
                  wrong’ and consequently allows users not only to ‘experience’
                  the resulting implications but also to reflect on those
                  implications as part of the learning process. This paper
                  discusses and presents the prototype for the first development
                  phase of the VR interactive training environment. While the
                  prototype was tested and validated with domain experts from
                  industry, the research community, and academia from different
                  EU countries, the data used in developing the prototype was
                  constrained to one project in the UK which may limit the
                  generalisability of results.},

                  proven to be more effective in delivering learning materials
                  to students. Video games have been introduced as one of the
                  possible new tools for educating the upcoming generation in
                  many different fields. Specifically, construction management
                  education has attempted to use simulation software to
                  introduce students to various construction concepts. However,

                  employment patterns, the UK construction industry recently has
                  made considerable efforts to attract more women to its
                  professions. However, despite their increasing representation,
                  there are indications that women experience difficulties in
                  developing their careers within the industry. This research
                  investigated the careers of men and women working for large
                  construction companies, in order to establish the gender
                  determined influences on women's career progression. A
                  primarily qualitative methodology was employed for the
                  research, in which career profiles were developed through
                  ethnographic interviews with 41 matched pairs of male and
                  female employees. This allowed the gender specific
                  determinants of careers to be established across a range of
                  different organizations, and from informants at different
                  vocational and life-cycle stages. The analysis resulted in the
                  formulation of a set of eight interrelated theoretical models,
                  from which a theory of women's career development was
                  constructed. The theory reflects the belief that the
                  construction workplace is a competitive and conflictual
                  environment, where women are overtly and covertly
                  discriminated against by men, who use structural systems to
                  undermine their participation. The women interviewed were
                  found to have dealt with these barriers in a way which
                  perpetuated existing work cultures. If reflected throughout
                  the industry, this would suggest the existence of a
                  self-fulfilling cycle of women's continued under-achievement.
                  The paper puts forward the radical proposition that women
                  should not be attracted to the industry unless steps are taken
                  to moderate its exclusionary and discriminatory culture.},

                  (Yizit and Yezim Denis, 2018) to promote knowledge-based
                  skills in various sectors in Malaysia. Anticipating this
                  change, the Malaysian Government initiated Technical
                  Vocational Education and Training (TVET) program to address
                  the issue during the early 90’s. However, the current highly

  abstract     = {Background Spatial skills are crucial for carpentry and are a
                  major learning objective in the initial vocational training of
                  carpenter apprentices. Carpenters specifically need to develop
                  the capability to switch between two-dimensional (2D) and
                  three-dimensional (3D) representations. Previous studies have
                  explored spatial skills, but never in the context of
                  vocational education and training (VET). This study sheds
                  light on the level and evolution of spatial skills in the
                  initial vocational training of carpenter apprentices in
                  Switzerland. Methods In this study, 726 subjects (98 females)
                  who were either carpenter apprentices, apprentices of another
                  profession, or high school students, took a test on spatial
                  skills with three parts: mental rotation, paper folding, and
                  orthographic projections. The first two parts are widely used
                  tests for spatial skills, while the last one was specifically
                  designed to address the 2D-3D transition that is a core skill
                  of carpenters. Results Carpenter apprentices do have higher
                  spatial skills than would be expected given their general
                  school level. In particular, their spatial skills were found
                  to be similar to those of high school students and superior to
                  those of apprentices of another profession. Carpenters’
                  spatial skills improve over the course of their
                  apprenticeship. These findings confirm that spatial skills are
                  trainable and suggest that the high spatial skills level of
                  carpenter apprentices is due to a selection bias as well as to
                  the training that they receive during their apprenticeship.
                  Conclusions Carpenter apprentices improve their spatial skills
                  over the time of their initial vocational training. As spatial
                  skills are crucial in this profession, there is a need to
                  develop further solutions that encourage further improvement
                  of teaching and learning activities for spatial skills.},

                  employment. Despite this turbulence, there remains a strong
                  nostalgia for manufacturing resulting in frequent public
                  policy discussion about how best to revitalise the industry. A
                  popular view is that a strong manufacturing industry relies
                  upon an equally strong vocational, education and training
                  (VET) system to provide requisite skill needs. Given the
                  dramatic pace of change in the manufacturing industry do such
                  arguments still hold true? This paper considers this question
                  through an examination of what the revitalisation of US
                  manufacturing means for employment and skills needs and the
                  extent to which US?s decentralised and largely eroded VET
                  system serves as a barrier to the industry?s revitalisation.
                  Drawing upon a mixed method approach that includes primary and
                  secondary data collected in three US cities, the paper argues
                  that the focus on needing to have a strong VET system
                  overlooks the emergence of flexible micro-skill ecosystems
                  that evolve to address local skill needs. These micro skill
                  eco-systems open the prospects for skills and training
                  innovations to meet changing workforce needs in a changing
                  industry.},

               ponders some of the spatial implications of such different models

               quite different geographical structures and loci of power than do
               those which are more centralized, for instance. The second

  abstract  = {A trade union is an organized association of workers formed for
               the protection and promotion of their common interests. The
               standard view of unions is that they are monopoly organizations
               that improve the welfare of members, principally by raising wages
               above the competitive level. For a union to be able to increase
               wage rates above the competitive level, there must be some
               surplus that can be shared between the firm and the union, and
               the union must have some bargaining power to induce the firm to
               share this surplus. This article investigates the conditions
               under which a union can increase wages, and explores ways of
               modeling the competing preferences of unions and management. The
               article also notes the arguments suggesting that, in the presence
               of imperfect information and uncertainty, unions may enhance
               efficiency. To the extent that unions reduce labor turnover and
               negotiating costs, they may increase the available surplus to be
               shared between parties.},

  abstract  = {The literature on social science methods and the issues
               surrounding them has grown massively and continues to increase.
               Yet many social scientists are ambivalent about methodology. For
               some, it plays a central, perhaps even an all-encompassing, role;
               while, for others, it is desirable only in small amounts, or
               indeed is regarded as an irrelevance, as a distraction from
               actually doing research. In this book, Hammersley argues that, in
               large part, this reflects and is part of a wider problem: the
               gradual decline of a previously influential academic model of
               inquiry. This has occurred as a result of ideological challenges
               and the erosion of the institutional conditions that support
               academic work. He defends this model, spelling out the demands it
               places upon social scientists, and examining such issues as the
               proper role of methodology, the nature of objectivity, the false
               idea that social scientists should be intellectuals or social
               critics, the dialectic of academic discussion, the ethics of
               belief, and the limits of academic freedom. More broadly, he also
               questions the role of the social research within society and what
               it means to be a social scientist in the 21st century.
               Hammersley′s book is engagingly written and controversial. It
               tackles the major issues of contemporary social research
               methodology head on and is an essential read for anyone with an
               interest in this field.},

                  minimize this and to reveal informal aspects and freshly
                  emerging themes from the case study data, it is proposed that
                  there is great value in analysing case studies on various
                  levels, through different phases using multiple methods.
                  Examples of the outcomes of applying multiple analyses
                  involving different approaches, such as grounded theory
                  methodology, rich picture diagrams and cognitive mapping, to
                  the same set of data from multiple case studies are presented
                  and discussed. This application of multiple analyses to case
                  study research of construction projects provides valuable
                  insights by revealing informal aspects and stimulating the
                  emergence of a fresh understanding of the processes and
                  interactions among different stakeholders. From the findings,
                  the limits of the formal management systems were revealed.
                  Further, the limits of tacit understanding around an evolving
                  shared vision for a project were found to be substantial
                  dimensions in understanding construction projects in a more
                  holistic way.},

               textbook can help students achieve success in their methods
               course or research project. Eight steps: Foolproof for any
               beginner researcher, the book breaks the process of designing and
               doing a research project into achievable stages. It delivers
               students from research problem to their written research report
               at the pace they need, with clear explanations, DIY tasks and
               study skills support. In a new landscape format it presents
               figures, models and visualizations elegantly, so they don't break
               over a page, making even complex concepts easier to understand.
               Two pathways: With an innovative, beautiful design, regular
               progress checkpoints have been built into the book and its online
               resources. As students proceed through the 8 steps, each chapter
               provides regular opportunities for students to check
               understanding or give themselves a challenge. Each pathway then
               gives them the resources they need. Confused? Stop, practise with
               quizzes and flashcards, or use a video to look at a concept a
               different way. Up for a challenge? Access a wealth of additional
               material including research articles, readings, case studies,
               activities, bibliography tools and inspiration to pursue your
               curiosity, impress your lecturer, and nail your assignments. With
               this one book, every student gets what they need to succeed. It
               is the perfect essential text for students and beginner
               researchers across the social sciences.},

                  theory in novel and productive ways. An interpretive,

                  the analytic edge of social justice studies. Simultaneously,
                  the critical inquiry inherent in social justice research can
                  enlarge the focus and deepen the significance of grounded
                  theory analyses. Combining the two approaches enhances the

  abstract    = {Modular construction has often been criticized for limiting
                 architects' creativity in design. However, new approaches are
                 changing this perception by emphasizing early collaboration
                 with fabricators to enable unique designs that meet clients'
                 diverse needs. Modular construction has several advantages,
                 including quality and safety, schedule efficiency, and
                 sustainability, making it an attractive option for owners and
                 project teams. The American Institute of Architects (AIA)
                 Modular and Off-Site Construction Guide serves as a primer for
                 architects to explore the value and opportunities of modular
                 design, potential pitfalls to avoid, and relevant case studies
                 that illustrate successes and obstacles.}

               architecture and industry has provided a rich and evolving source
               for historians of architecture. In a historical context,
               industrial architecture evokes the smoking factories of the
               nineteenth century or Fordist production complexes of the
               twentieth century. This book documents the changing nature of
               industrial building and planning from the end of the nineteenth
               century to the beginning of the twenty-first century. Drawing on
               research from the United States, Europe and Australia, this
               collection of essays highlights key moments in industrial
               architecture and planning representative of the wider paradigms
               in the field. Areas of analysis include industrial production,
               factories, hydroelectricity, aerospace, logistics, finance,
               scientific research and mining. The selected case studies serve
               to highlight architectural and planning innovations in industry
               and their contributions to wider cultural and societal currents.
               This richly illustrated collection will be of interest for a wide

                  accident rate and many practitioners consider a preventative
                  approach to be the most important means of bringing about
                  improvements. The purpose of this paper is to address previous
                  research and the weaknesses of existing preventative
                  approaches and then to describe and illustrate a new
                  application involving the use of a multi‐dimensional
                  simulation tool – Construction Virtual Prototyping
                  (CVP).Design/methodology/approachA literature review was
                  conducted to investigate previous studies of hazard
                  identification and safety management and to develop the new
                  approach. Due to weaknesses in current practice, the research
                  study explored the use of computer simulation techniques to
                  create virtual environments where users can explore and
                  identify construction hazards. Specifically, virtual
                  prototyping technology was deployed to develop typical
                  construction scenarios in which unsafe or hazardous incidents
                  occur. In a case study, the users' performance was evaluated
                  based on their responses to incidents within the virtual
                  environment and the effectiveness of the computer simulation
                  system established though interviews with the safety project
                  management team.FindingsThe opinions and suggestions provided
                  by the interviewees led to the initial conclusion that the
                  simulation tool was useful in assisting the safety management
                  team's hazard identification process during the early design
                  stage.Originality/valueThe paper introduces an innovative
                  method to support the management team's reviews of
                  construction site safety. The system utilises
                  three‐dimensional modelling and four‐dimensional simulation of
                  worker behaviour, a configuration that has previously not been
                  employed in construction simulations. An illustration of the
                  method's use is also provided, together with a consideration
                  of its strengths and weaknesses.},

                  market by 2030. However, UK construction productivity
                  performance is regarded as weak, with low skills levels
                  considered to be a key contributory factor. Consequently,
                  off-site construction has been identified by the UK Government
                  as a vehicle for improving productivity levels if the skills
                  deficiencies in this particular market segment can be
                  addressed. A series of projects were, therefore, launched by
                  the UK Commission for Employment and Skills (UKCES) to
                  encourage an R\&D approach to skills and development
                  application in the workplace. This paper reports on one of
                  these research projects, a University and Industry
                  collaboration between two of the largest off-site timber
                  platform frame manufacturers in the UK. The paper explains how
                  a needs analysis process was utilised to develop skills
                  training content tailored to the immediate needs of the
                  industry partners. It also explores how working with academia
                  and a wider community of stakeholders allowed this training
                  content to result in sector-level impact via knowledge
                  exchange activities and generic skills material creation.
                  Finally, the novel approach of utilising ?Hoshin? planning to
                  form a larger regional Offsite HUB (Scotland) Community of
                  Practice, with a developed plan for collaboration aligned with
                  international off-site research objectives, is also explained.
                  The case study presented in this paper is evidence of success
                  in mobilising industry through creating communities of
                  practice to advance the construction sector regionally. It
                  also provides a generalisable method that is reproducible by
                  other university?industry cohorts in order to realise shared

                4.0 framework for the construction sector. Industry 4.0 promises
                to revolutionize how ‘things’ are made by using physical and
                digital technologies in an integrated manner. Similarly, the
                authors envision that the Construction 4.0 framework can
                fundamentally change the way that assets are designed,
                constructed, and operated. The idea of the Construction 4.0
                developed from the need of the construction sector to overcome
                the existing horizontal, vertical, and longitudinal
                fragmentation and to take a holistic approach to the
                improvements needed in the industry. In this study, a literature
                review of Industry 4.0 and its influence on the construction
                sector was undertaken. Based on this systematic literature
                review, the authors define the Construction 4.0 framework and
                provide its benefits and barriers to implementation. A key
                finding of the study is that building information modeling, and
                a common data environment form the key foundation for the
                implementation of the Construction 4.0 framework. In defining
                the Construction 4.0 framework, the paper described its
                components and how its implementation is likely to proceed. The
                authors envision that by adopting Construction 4.0, the industry
                can transform itself into a highly efficient, quality-centered,
                and safe industry capable of successfully delivering the demands

                  shortages in the labour market with special emphasis on the
                  construction sector in the European Union Member States,
                  foreseeing the Construction 4.0 era. The free movement of
                  people is one of the rights of all citizens of the EU which
                  also includes the free movement of workers. Labour shortages
                  in the EU are expected to increase in the future due to a
                  declining population and an ageing workforce. In order to
                  recognize and forecast labour shortages, EU Member states use
                  a variety of instruments but they do not answer as to whether
                  it is possible to use migrant labour to appease those
                  shortages. There are several systems used to classify labour
                  shortages in the EU Member states. Most of the countries
                  classify labour shortages in relation to different sectors or
                  occupation groups as well as by skill levels, but in some
                  Member States, classification is made according to the type of
                  employment. Instruments used to measure labour shortages
                  significantly differ from country to country. Several criteria
                  are used for creating lists of shortage occupations and most
                  of the criteria include demand side and supply side criteria.
                  A majority of the Member States are facing labour and skill
                  shortages in various sectors and the construction sector is
                  not an exception. As total employment in the construction
                  sector decreased, so did the share of employed migrants.
                  Labour shortages in the construction sector can be eased by
                  the availability of a labour supply willing to accept
                  unqualified and low-paying jobs. The construction sector seeks
                  low-, medium-, and high-skilled individuals and is most likely
                  the sector where most of the incoming migrants will be
                  working, which has an impact on the development and
                  implementation dynamic of Construction 4.0.},

                  characterized by low production rate, low technological
                  advancement, minimum automation and robotic usage, and so on.
                  With the visionary idea of Industry 4.0 that focuses on
                  digitization of the value chain of a product and improving
                  productivity through a variety of technologies and automated
                  manufacturing environment, this research aims to develop a
                  framework to adopt Construction 4.0 within a construction
                  company. Current state of the art of the technologies in
                  construction associated with the notion of Industry 4.0 (e.g.,
                  Building Information Modelling, virtual reality, augmented
                  reality, Drone, etc.) is explored through extensive literature
                  studies. The proposed framework incorporates current
                  technological advancement related to construction industry,
                  legislative requirements, barriers, enterprise transformation
                  requirements and so on. Construction 4.0 would make a great
                  impact in construction industry through improved value chain
                  of construction projects, productivity improvement, and safe
                  and sustainable construction. Indeed, the proposed framework
                  would contribute to the advancement of new knowledge in the
                  worlds' construction companies and provide potentials of new

               examines the critical technologies of Construction 4.0, such as
               building information modelling (BIM), robotic construction, 3D
               printing and drones, which have transformed the construction

                  focused on the construction industry workforce and integration
                  of educational theory in training creation or implementation.
                  Literature meeting these criteria are summarized and a case

                  propose that tacit knowledge sharing consists of three
                  specific behaviors (i.e., socialization, externalization, and
                  internalization) and they are influenced by four antecedents
                  (trust, self-efficacy, knowledge tacitness, and IT support). A
                  survey was conducted to collect data from 258 knowledge
                  workers who worked on complex product development projects.
                  Structural equation modeling was used to analyze the data. The
                  results demonstrate that trust, self-efficacy, knowledge
                  tacitness, and IT support significantly affect the
                  externalization and internalization behaviors, and trust and
                  IT support significantly affect the socialization behavior.
                  This study is helpful to organizations where it is critical
                  for employees to share tacit knowledge. It suggests that tacit
                  knowledge is difficult to share and organizations should
                  nurture mutual trust between employees, enhance their
                  self-efficacy, and provide sufficient IT support so that they

               of the twenty-first century. Within two decades, aspects of daily
               human life will be unrecognizable. AI will generate unprecedented
               wealth, revolutionize medicine and education through
               human-machine symbiosis, and create brand new forms of
               communication and entertainment. In liberating us from routine
               work, however, AI will also challenge the organizing principles

  abstract     = {CONTEXT: Evidence suggests that clinicians may not be learning
                  effectively from all facets of their practice, potentially
                  because their training has not fully prepared them to do so.
                  To address this gap, we argue that there is a need to identify
                  systems of instruction and assessment that enhance clinicians'
                  'preparation for future learning'. Preparation for future
                  learning (PFL) is understood to be the capacity to learn new
                  information, to use resources effectively and innovatively,
                  and to invent new strategies for learning and problem solving
                  in practice. CURRENT STATE: Education researchers have
                  developed study designs that use dynamic assessments to
                  measure what trainees have acquired in the past, as well as
                  what they are able to learn in the present. More recently,
                  researchers have also started to emphasise and measure whether
                  and how trainees take action to gain the information they need
                  to learn. Knowing that there are study designs and emerging
                  metrics for assessing PFL, the next question is how to design
                  instruction that helps trainees develop PFL capacities.
                  Although research evidence is still accumulating, the current
                  evidence base suggests training that encourages 'productive
                  failure' through guided discovery learning (i.e. where
                  trainees solve problems and perform tasks without direct
                  instruction, though often with some form of feedback) creates
                  challenging conditions that enhance learning and equip
                  trainees with PFL-related behaviours. CONCLUSIONS: Preparation
                  for future learning and the associated capacity of being
                  adaptive as one learns in and from training and clinical
                  practice have been missed in most contemporary training and
                  assessment systems. We propose a research agenda that (i)
                  explores how real-world adaptive expert activity unfolds in
                  the health care workplace to inform the design of instruction
                  for developing PFL, (ii) identifies measures of behaviours
                  that relate to PFL, and (iii) addresses potential
                  sociocultural barriers that limit clinicians' opportunities to
                  learn from their daily practice.},

  abstract     = {Abstract Human one-to-one tutoring has been shown to be a very
                  effective form of instruction. Three contrasting hypotheses, a
                  tutor-centered one, a student-centered one, and an interactive
                  one could all potentially explain the effectiveness of
                  tutoring. To test these hypotheses, analyses focused not only
                  on the effectiveness of the tutors' moves, but also on the
                  effectiveness of the students' construction on learning, as
                  well as their interaction. The interaction hypothesis is
                  further tested in the second study by manipulating the kind of
                  tutoring tactics tutors were permitted to use. In order to
                  promote a more interactive style of dialogue, rather than a
                  didactic style, tutors were suppressed from giving
                  explanations and feedback. Instead, tutors were encouraged to
                  prompt the students. Surprisingly, students learned just as
                  effectively even when tutors were suppressed from giving
                  explanations and feedback. Their learning in the interactive
                  style of tutoring is attributed to construction from deeper
                  and a greater amount of scaffolding episodes, as well as their
                  greater effort to take control of their own learning by
                  reading more. What they learned from reading was limited,

  abstract     = {Cross laminated timber (CLT) has become a well-known
                  engineered timber product of global interest. The orthogonal,
                  laminar structure allows its application as a full-size wall
                  and floor element as well as a linear timber member, able to
                  bear loads in- and out-of-plane. This article provides a
                  state-of-the-art report on some selected topics related to
                  CLT, in particular production and technology, characteristic
                  material properties, design and connections. Making use of
                  general information concerning the product’s development and
                  global market, the state of knowledge is briefly outlined,
                  including the newest findings and related references for
                  background information. In view of ongoing global activities,
                  a significant rise in production volume within the next decade
                  is expected. Prerequisites for the establishment of a solid
                  timber construction system using CLT are (1) standards
                  comprising the product, testing and design, (2) harmonized
                  load-bearing models for calculating CLT properties based on
                  the properties of the base material board, enabling relatively
                  fast use of local timber species and qualities, and (3) the
                  development of CLT adequate connection systems for economic
                  assembling and an increasing degree of utilization regarding
                  the load-bearing potential of CLT elements in the joints. The
                  establishment of a worldwide harmonized package of standards
                  is recommended as this would broaden the fields of application
                  for timber engineering and strengthen CLT in competition with
                  solid-mineral based building materials.},

                  collaborative learning environments that adapt their
                  characteristics, and sometimes provide intelligent hints and
                  feedback, to improve individual students’ collaborative
                  interactions. ACLS often involves a system that can
                  automatically assess student dialogue, model effective and
                  ineffective collaboration, and provide relevant support. While
                  there is evidence that ACLS can improve student learning,
                  little is known about why systems that incorporate ACLS are
                  effective. Does relevant support improve student interactions
                  by providing just-in-time feedback, or do students who believe
                  they are receiving relevant support feel more accountable for
                  the collaboration, and thus more motivated to improve their
                  interactions? In this paper, we describe an adaptive system we
                  have developed to support help-giving during peer tutoring in
                  high school algebra: the Adaptive Peer Tutoring Assistant
                  (APTA). To validate our approach, we conducted a controlled
                  study that demonstrated that our system provided students with
                  more relevant support and was more effective at improving
                  student learning than parallel nonadaptive conditions. Our
                  contributions involve generalizable techniques for
                  implementing ACLS that can function adaptively and
                  effectively, and the finding that adaptive support does indeed
                  improve student learning because of the relevance of the
                  support.},

               indicators reflect this shift: fewer people are working, and
               wages are falling even as productivity and profits soar. Drawing
               on years of research and up-to-the-minute trends, Brynjolfsson
               and McAfee identify the best strategies for survival and offer a
               new path to prosperity. These include revamping education so that
               it prepares people for the next economy instead of the last one,
               designing new collaborations that pair brute processing power
               with human ingenuity, and embracing policies that make sense in a
               radically transformed landscape. A fundamentally optimistic book,
               The Second Machine Age will alter how we think about issues of
               technological, societal, and economic progress.},

                  identified as important technologies that could reimagine
                  spatial information delivery and enhance higher education
                  practice. However, there is limited research on the impact of
                  mobile MR (MMR) within construction education and improvement
                  of the learners’ experience. With new building information
                  modelling (BIM) workflows being adopted within the
                  architecture, engineering and construction industry,
                  innovative MMR pedagogical delivery methods should be explored
                  to enhance this information-rich spatial technology workflow.
                  This paper outlines qualitative results derived through
                  thematic analysis of learner reflections from two
                  technology-enhanced lessons involving a lecture and a hands-on
                  workshop focussed on MMR-BIM delivered within postgraduate
                  construction education. Seventy participants across the two
                  lessons recruited from an Australian university participated
                  to answer the research question: ‘Does applied mobile mixed
                  reality create an enhanced learning environment for students?’
                  The results of the analysis suggest that using MMR-BIM can
                  result in an enhanced learning environment that facilitates
                  unique learning experiences, engagement and motivation.
                  However, the study outcome suggests that to understand the
                  processes leading to these learning aspects, further empirical
                  research on the topic is required. This paper is part of the

               understand economic and political polarization in the age of
               automation From the Industrial Revolution to the age of
               artificial intelligence, The Technology Trap takes a sweeping
               look at the history of technological progress and how it has
               radically shifted the distribution of economic and political
               power among society's members. As Carl Benedikt Frey shows, the
               Industrial Revolution created unprecedented wealth and prosperity
               over the long run, but the immediate consequences of
               mechanization were devastating for large swaths of the
               population. Middle-income jobs withered, wages stagnated, the
               labor share of income fell, profits surged, and economic
               inequality skyrocketed. These trends, Frey documents, broadly
               mirror those in our current age of automation, which began with
               the Computer Revolution. Just as the Industrial Revolution
               eventually brought about extraordinary benefits for society,
               artificial intelligence systems have the potential to do the
               same. But Frey argues that this depends on how the short term is
               managed. In the nineteenth century, workers violently expressed
               their concerns over machines taking their jobs. The Luddite
               uprisings joined a long wave of machinery riots that swept across
               Europe and China. Today's despairing middle class has not
               resorted to physical force, but their frustration has led to
               rising populism and the increasing fragmentation of society. As
               middle-class jobs continue to come under pressure, there's no
               assurance that positive attitudes to technology will persist. The
               Industrial Revolution was a defining moment in history, but few
               grasped its enormous consequences at the time. The Technology
               Trap demonstrates that in the midst of another technological
               revolution, the lessons of the past can help us to more
               effectively face the present.},

               of perfection that men might seek. The first and lowest form is
               perfection in the acquisition of worldly goods. The great
               philosopher dismisses such perfection on the ground that the
               possessions one acquires bear no meaningful relation to the
               possessor: “A great king may one morning find that there is no
               difference between him and the lowest person.” A second
               perfection is of the body, its conformation and skills. Its
               failing is that is does not reflect on what is uniquely human
               about man: “he could [in any case] not be as strong as a mule.”
               Moral perfection is the third, “the highest degree of excellency
               in man’s character.” Of this perfection Maimonides says: “Imagine
               a person being alone, and having no connection whatever with any
               other person; all his good moral principles are at rest, they are
               not required and give man no perfection whatever. These
               principles are only necessary and useful when man comes in
               contact with others.” “The fourth kind of perfection is the true
               perfection of man; the possession of the highest intellectual
               faculties . . . .” In justification of his assertion, this
               extraordinary Spanish-Judaic philosopher urges: “Examine the
               first three kinds of perfection; you will find that if you
               possess them, they are not your property, but the property of
               others . . . . But the last kind of perfection is exclusively
               yours; no one else owns any part of it.”},

  abstract     = {This paper traces the origins of the scaffolding construct,
                  placing it in its theoretical-historical context. The paper
                  discusses the connection between Vygotsky’s Zone of Proximal
                  Development (ZPD), and the notion of scaffolding, and
                  explicates the differences between scaffolding and scaffolds.
                  The paper then presents a discussion of the changes that the
                  notion of scaffolding has undergone, especially when it comes
                  to supporting students in classroom contexts. In classrooms
                  where one teacher supports multiple students, scaffolding is
                  distributed across various tools and social scaffolds. A
                  discussion of the notion of distributed scaffolding is
                  presented, to describe how students in classrooms may be
                  supported by various tools and social scaffolds. The paper
                  then introduces the kinds of distribution and interactions
                  between tools and social scaffolds that need to be considered
                  to support multiple students in classroom contexts. Finally,
                  distributed scaffolding is discussed with reference to the key
                  features of scaffolding, especially fading and transfer of
                  responsibility.},
